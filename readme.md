# Resonite/NeosVR Extract json file
Intended as a complement program for the mod [ExportResoniteToJson](https://github.com/LimeProgramming/ExportResoniteToJson).

This will take the Resonite BSON, BRSON, 7ZBSON, LZ4BSON file type and convert them to Json format which you should be able to import back into Resonite with the use of ExportResoniteToJson mod.

Should also work for NeosVR natively without needing a mod to import the exported Json to NeosVR, but the file will need to come from NeosVR to begin with so the links can resolve properly. Use the [ExportNeosToJson](https://github.com/zkxs/ExportNeosToJson) mod to get those files.
